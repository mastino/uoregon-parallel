The file "output000.vtk" is a small sample pf the vtk format to load onto a viewer
such as Visit (which is on WOPR) it may be best to run the viewer locally.

The vtk format is described in a PDF here: 

http://vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf


If you write an output a file per update cycle and name each file 
with an increasing integer they will play as an animation.

"Visit" viewer  downloads for all common platforms:
