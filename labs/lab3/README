In the third lab of the term you will be using TAU to generate some performance
profiling data.

Your grade on this lab is based on having checked in the profiles generated from
using TAU on tauTest and a text file "readme.txt" containing insights you gained
from looking at the performance data (not more than a paragraph). Make sure to run 
with more than one thread.

#  What to do
################################################################################

1. Pull files from the git repository if necessary.

2. Compile and run with TAU (instrumentation-based profiling).
   * Start by measuring just time
   * Once that works, experiment with some PAPI hardware counters (papi_avail to see list of available ones)
   * Use Paraprof to view the data; compute a derived metric, such as "cycles per instruction"

2a. Optionally, repeat the measurements in step 2 on your own application.

3.  Write briefly (1-3 paragraphs) about what you see in the data created in step 2 in a results.txt file, add, commit and push it to your lab3 directory in your bitbucket repo. 

4. Due date is before lab in week 5.
