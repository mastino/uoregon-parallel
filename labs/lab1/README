1. Check out the repository into your WOPR home with the command:

      git clone http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Classes/15S/cis410parallel/repo.git

2. Examine then run the Makefile and look at the source code and output of
   running each of the programs.

3. You will not need to make your repo readable by 'all' as we will change your
   repo's group to be accessible to the instructors.  We will pull your
   repository to check your results.

#  What to do
################################################################################nge

When finished with this lab you will have verified your access to wopr.uoregon.edu
and the workstations in the lab; you will also have checked out this repository
and compiled a HelloWorld application in each of the three languages.

Your grade on this lab is based on altering the helloWorld.c source to: 

    1. Vary the number of threads to use and only output the number of threads
       the program is called with.

    2. Add a "check" target to Makefile that calls the program you altered using
       the bash time command with a varing numbers of threads 1,2,4,8,16 & 32.

    3. Finally commit the changes back into you repository so we can pull your
       changes and type 'make check' to ensure you have completed the exercise.

  Note: Using the bash time command to measure performance is not a recommended 
  	way to measure performance, but we all have to start somewhere.
