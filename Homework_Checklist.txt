Before your instructors ever see your homework, 
you have full knowledge of whether or not there 
even *could* be anything there for them to grade.

These checks are independent of any particular exercise, 
but typically necessary for all.



1) Clone your repo so you are seeing what the instructors will be seeing.

2) Do all the necessary files exist?

3) Are there any unnecessary files present? ( i.e. binaries)

4) Entering 'make clean' in a freshly cloned repo should change nothing.

5) Entering 'make' will execute the first rule listed in the Makefile 
	(traditionally named 'all') which should build all your executables.

6) Entering 'make <target>' should not result in the compiler barfing.

7) Entering variants of 'make check' should run a version of your executable 
	which is not older that the sources it is built from.

8) 'make check' variants should not obviously crash. 

9) 'make clean' should remove all files created by other make targets.

10) Are your parallel outputs logically congruent with your serial output?

11) Do you have time and space performance metrics relative to serial?

12) Have you written up your critical observations and documented your code?
